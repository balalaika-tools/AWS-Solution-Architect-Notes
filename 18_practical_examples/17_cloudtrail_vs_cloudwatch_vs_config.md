## 1. Three Questions, Three Services

The fastest way to pick the right service on the exam is to phrase the requirement as a
question and match it to a verb:

| The question | The verb | Service |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| **"Who deleted this S3 bucket?"** | *Who did what?* (audit) | **CloudTrail** |
| **"Is CPU > 80%? Alert me."** | *Is it healthy?* (performance/health) | **CloudWatch** |
| **"Which SGs allow 0.0.0.0/0 on 22, and when did that change?"** | *Is it compliant / what's its state history?* | **AWS Config** |

> **Key insight**: CloudTrail records the **action** (an API call happened). CloudWatch
> records **metrics & logs** (how the system is performing). Config records the **resulting
> resource state** and evaluates it against rules. CloudTrail = *who*, CloudWatch = *how
> healthy*, Config = *configured correctly and how it changed*.

---

## 2. "Who deleted this S3 bucket?" → CloudTrail

CloudTrail logs every API call (console, CLI, SDK) as an **event**: who, what, when, from
where. To answer the bucket-deletion question you look up the `DeleteBucket` event.

```bash
aws cloudtrail lookup-events \
  --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventName,AttributeValue=DeleteBucket \
  --start-time 2026-05-30T00:00:00Z
```

A trimmed `DeleteBucket` event record:

```json
{
  "eventTime": "2026-06-01T14:03:22Z",
  "eventSource": "s3.amazonaws.com",
  "eventName": "DeleteBucket",
  "awsRegion": "us-east-1",
  "sourceIPAddress": "203.0.113.42",
  "userIdentity": {
    "type": "IAMUser",
    "userName": "dev-alice",
    "arn": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/dev-alice"
  },
  "requestParameters": { "bucketName": "prod-customer-uploads" },
  "responseElements": null,
  "readOnly": false,
  "managementEvent": true,
  "eventCategory": "Management"
}
```

There it is: `dev-alice` deleted `prod-customer-uploads` at 14:03 from `203.0.113.42`.

⚠️ CloudTrail logs **management events** (control-plane: create/delete/modify) by default.
**Data events** (S3 object-level `GetObject`/`PutObject`, Lambda `Invoke`) are high-volume,
**not logged by default**, and cost extra. "Who *read* this object?" needs data events enabled.

💡 The default **Event history** keeps **90 days** of management events. For longer retention
or org-wide capture, create a **Trail** delivering to S3 (and optionally CloudWatch Logs).

## 3. "Is CPU > 80%? Alert me." → CloudWatch

This is a metric crossing a threshold — squarely CloudWatch. (Full alarm→scaling mechanics in
[16_cloudwatch_alarm_scaling.md](16_cloudwatch_alarm_scaling.md).)

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
  --alarm-name ec2-cpu-over-80 \
  --namespace AWS/EC2 \
  --metric-name CPUUtilization \
  --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=i-0abc1234 \
  --statistic Average --period 300 \
  --evaluation-periods 2 --threshold 80 \
  --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold \
  --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:111122223333:ops-alerts
```

CloudWatch owns **metrics** (numeric health), **Logs** (application/system log lines), and
**alarms** (threshold → action). It answers *is the system performing acceptably* — never
*who did it*.

❌ Common trap: "alert when an unauthorized API call happens." That sounds like CloudWatch but
the *source* of API activity is **CloudTrail**. You send CloudTrail to a **CloudWatch Logs
metric filter**, then alarm on that. CloudWatch alone has no idea who called an API.

---

## 4. "Which SGs allow 0.0.0.0/0 on 22, and when did it change?" → Config

This is a **resource-state + history + compliance** question — AWS Config. Config records a
**configuration item** every time a resource changes and evaluates state against **rules**.

```bash
# Turn on the AWS-managed rule for SSH open to the world
aws configservice put-config-rule --config-rule '{
  "ConfigRuleName": "restricted-ssh",
  "Source": {
    "Owner": "AWS",
    "SourceIdentifier": "INCOMING_SSH_DISABLED"
  },
  "Scope": { "ComplianceResourceTypes": ["AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup"] }
}'

# Which SGs are non-compliant (i.e., allow 0.0.0.0/0 on 22)?
aws configservice get-compliance-details-by-config-rule \
  --config-rule-name restricted-ssh \
  --compliance-types NON_COMPLIANT

# When did THIS SG's configuration change?
aws configservice get-resource-config-history \
  --resource-type AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup \
  --resource-id sg-0abc1234
```

Config answers **both halves**: the *current* non-compliant set (the rule) **and** the
*timeline* of how `sg-0abc1234` got there (the configuration history, with before/after).

💡 Config can auto-fix via **remediation actions** (e.g., an SSM Automation document that
revokes the open rule) and can notify on every change/compliance flip via SNS.

## 5. The Big Three-Way Comparison

| | **CloudTrail** | **CloudWatch** | **AWS Config** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core question | *Who did what, when, from where?* | *Is it healthy / performing?* | *Is it configured right? How did it change?* |
| Primary data | API call **events** | **Metrics** & **Logs** | **Configuration items** (resource state) |
| Records | The **action** (request) | Numeric series + log lines | The **resulting state** + relationships |
| Granularity | Per API call | Per metric datapoint / log event | Per resource change (snapshot) |
| Compliance rules | No | No | **Yes** (managed + custom rules) |
| History | 90 days (Event history); ∞ via Trail→S3 | Metric retention up to 15 mo; logs as configured | Full per-resource timeline |
| Alerting | Via CloudWatch Logs metric filter | **Alarms** → SNS/Auto Scaling | Compliance change → SNS / EventBridge |
| Typical answer keyword | "audit", "who", "forensics", "API call" | "metric", "threshold", "CPU/latency", "alarm" | "compliant", "drift", "configuration change", "0.0.0.0/0" |
| Scope | Regional/org trail | Regional | Regional (aggregator for org) |

> **Rule of thumb**: see **"who / audit / API call"** → CloudTrail. See **"metric / threshold
> / utilization / latency / alarm"** → CloudWatch. See **"compliant / drift / configuration /
> security-group rule / over time"** → Config.

## 6. How They Overlap and Feed Each Other

They're complementary, not competitors. A single incident often touches all three:

```
                          ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
   API call (someone      │            AWS account activity           │

            │             │                                           │
            ▼             │                                           │

            │             │              ▼                            │
            │             │     ┌──────────────────┐  metric filter   │

            │             │                                           │
            │ triggers re-evaluation                                  │
            ▼             │                                           │
   ┌─────────────────┐    │   records the STATE + checks the RULE     │
   │   AWS Config     │───┼─── NON_COMPLIANT ──▶ EventBridge / SNS ──▶ remediation
   └─────────────────┘    │                                           │
                          └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **CloudTrail → CloudWatch Logs**: ship trail events into a log group, add a **metric
  filter** (e.g., count `AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress` with cidr `0.0.0.0/0`), alarm on it.
- **Config → SNS / EventBridge**: every configuration/compliance change publishes a
  notification, enabling near-real-time alerts and auto-remediation.
- **CloudTrail and Config together**: CloudTrail says *"`dev-alice` called
  `AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress` at 14:03"*; Config says *"as a result `sg-0abc1234` is now
  NON_COMPLIANT, and here's the before/after diff."* The action vs the resulting state.

## 7. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Can't find who **read** an S3 object in CloudTrail | Only management events logged | Enable **data events** for the bucket (extra cost) |
| Trail events older than 90 days missing | Relying on Event history, no Trail | Create a Trail → S3 for long-term retention |
| Config shows no history for a resource | Recorder not recording that resource type / not enabled in Region | Enable the **configuration recorder**; check resource-type scope |
| CloudWatch alarm never fires on "unauthorized API" | CloudWatch has no API data | Route CloudTrail → CloudWatch Logs, add a metric filter, alarm on it |
| Config rule shows everything compliant but you see open SG | Rule scope excludes SGs, or rule not the SSH one | Verify `SourceIdentifier`/scope; rules are evaluated only against in-scope types |
| Need org-wide view | Per-account/Region services | CloudTrail **org trail**; Config **aggregator**; CloudWatch **cross-account observability** |

---

## Key Exam Points

- **CloudTrail = who/what/when (audit)**, **CloudWatch = health/metrics/alarms**, **Config =
  resource state + compliance + change history**. Memorize the three verbs.
- CloudTrail default = **management events**, **90-day** Event history; **data events** off by
  default; Trail → S3 for long retention.
- "Alert on an API call / unauthorized activity" = **CloudTrail → CloudWatch Logs metric
  filter → alarm** (not CloudWatch alone).
- Config is the only one with **rules, compliance, and per-resource history** — anything with
  "drift", "compliant", "0.0.0.0/0", or "how did this resource change over time" is Config.
- They chain: **CloudTrail → CloudWatch Logs**, **Config → SNS/EventBridge → remediation**.
  CloudTrail logs the action; Config records the resulting state.
